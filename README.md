# Sweetie
Sweetie is a One-To-One app thought and designed to be the main 
communication and sharing tool for a couple relationship. 
Every conversation, photo, images, to-do lists, localized
messages and memory of the couple will pass through Sweetie.
The idea was born from the need of an intimate and special
place for the couple in our smartphone that is not satisfied by
’general purpose’ platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook.
The application described in this paper is the first step in
order to show a minimal product to potential investors. The
main features built are:
- Multiple chats based on the today’s standard of messaging
apps leader, WhatsApp and Telegram;
- Galleries that are containers of images grouped by both
partners;
- Infos of Chat, Gallery and To-Do list, accessible from the
menu of each, show the date of creation and, optional, the
photo cover. Only for the galleries there is the optional
placement, selectable through a Location Picker UI;
- To-Do lists managed by both, for any kind of topic, like
grocery list, movies to watch, trips to plan;
- Geogift, are messages like a post-it, pictures or emoticons, 
geolocalized. The partner won’t know about the gift
until he/she will come exactly on that physical place e.g.,
a specific street address or store in the city. This thanks to
the geofence, a virtual perimeter set on a real geographic
area that should be monitored by a service. The simplest
geofence to be created needs of center position, explicated
by latitude and longitude, and the radius of circle area,
setted in meters. When the boundary of geofence is
crossed, the user is alerted by a push notification. This
feature need to be enable manually in the settings activity;
- Maps to see, as a markers, the Geogifts sent or discovered
and the galleries that have a photo cover and a location
specified;
- Calendar where to easily visualize the own saved message
(bookmarked).

We don’t put so much effort into usability and accessibility
that an Android app needed, for example our app lacks
of a initial tutorial or a welcome page where the user is
instructed with what he could do with Sweetie furthermore
some important feature: image compression and a complete
notifications service were not implemented, we preferred to
invest the last works time to test our application in order to
fix underhand bugs. The application is built and tested for
Android Lollipop 5.1, Marshmallow 6.0 and Nougat 7.0, these
version are almost the 70% of the market and we think that
when Sweetie will be release the percentage will increase.
